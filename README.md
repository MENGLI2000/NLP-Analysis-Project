b) implement a function find_imp_characters() that takes the list obtained in (a), an optional parameter top_x that defaults to 20, and any other parameters you deem necessary, and returns a list of the most important characters in the book.

c) create a dispersion_plot of 20-most important characters in the first book. Name the 5 most important characters based on your dispersion_plot.

d) implement a function find_mentions() that takes the name of a book, name of a character and returns a list of sentences where this character appears.

e) implement a function good_person_score() that takes the list of sentences where a character is mentioned, the name of the character, and any other parameters you deem necessary, and return a numeric value.
