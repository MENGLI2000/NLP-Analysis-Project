    "a) implement a function find_all_characters() that takes the name of a book (this could be the filename of the file containing the book) and any other parameters you deem necessary, and return the list of characters that appear in the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) implement a function find_imp_characters() that takes the list obtained in (a), an optional parameter top_x that defaults to 20, and any other parameters you deem necessary, and returns a list of the most important characters in the book. [Note: clearly state your criterion for measuring importance in your comments] \n",
    "\n",
    "c) create a dispersion_plot of 20-most important characters in the first book. Name the 5 most important characters based on your dispersion_plot. \n",

    "d) implement a function find_mentions() that takes the name of a book, name of a character and returns a list of sentences where this character appears. \n",

    "e) implement a function good_person_score() that takes the list of sentences where a character is mentioned, the name of the character, and any other parameters you deem necessary, and return a numeric value.\n",

    "f) implement a function good_and_bad_guys() that takes the name of a book and returns a dictionary of key-value pairs where the key is the name of a character and the value is their score. "

Rowling    “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.', 'He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”   Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling    Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward  over the bundle of blankets.', 'Well — give him  here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned  toward the Dursleys’ house.', 'He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry  and gave him what must have been a very scratchy,  whiskery kiss.', '“But I c-c-  can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little  Harry off ter live with Muggles — ”  “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,  Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall  whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as  Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and  walked to the front door.', 'He laid Harry gently on the  Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling    doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it  inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the  other two.', '“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured.', 'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which  lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last  Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling    place you would expect astonishing things to happen.', 'Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without  waking up.', 'He couldn’t know that at this very  moment, people meeting in secret all over the country  were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed  voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”   Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling     THE VANASHIG GLASS  Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had  woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but  Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.', 'Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,  but not for long.', 'His Aunt Petunia was awake and it   Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.

Rowling    When he was dressed he went down the hall into the  kitchen.', 'Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a  mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated  exercise — unless of course it involved punching  somebody.', 'Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry,  but he couldn’t often catch him.', 'Harry didn’t look it,  but he was very fast.', 'Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark  cupboard, but Harry had always been small and  skinny for his age.', 'Harry had a thin  face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green  eyes.', 'The only thing Harry liked  about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his  forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.', 'Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was  turning over the bacon.', 'Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling    About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top  of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a  haircut.', 'Harry must have had more haircuts than the  rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made  no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over  the place.', 'Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in  the kitchen with his mother.', 'Aunt Petunia  often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel —  Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a  wig.', 'Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table,  which was difficult as there wasn’t much room.', 'Harry, who could see a huge Dudley  tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as  fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.', 'Is that all right?”   Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
